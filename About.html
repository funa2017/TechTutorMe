<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<h3>In today's society, education is extremely important to the intellectual growth and development of our youth. Our mission is to promote accessibility to education, specifically for those who have limited access to quality education. We hope to be able to provide a safe, interactive, and dynamic site that will benefit students profoundly.
</h3>
<h2>Our Teachers</h2>
<h3>We are very selective when hiring our teachers. Since our goal is to provide the best education possible for students, we choose the most qualified and well rounded individuals to join our site. All of our teachers are required to be certified, have at least a masterâ€™s degree, and pass a series of knowledge and skill exams.
</h3>
<h2>Our Founders</h2>
<h3>Our founders are two high school seniors from Greenbelt, Maryland. Muna Hassen and Farida Abubakar are two 17 year old girls with ameateur experience in coding, but proffessional experience in helping others. Their goal is not only to create a free site in which students will be able to access quality level education, but to increase educational accessibility on a global level.
</h3>
<h2>Our Future</h2>
<h3>Since we are a relatively new organization, we do not have all the resources and equipment necessary to do all the things that we want to. We do the best with what we have, but in the future we would love to be able to expand our platform and design a way in which we could include face to face tutoring sessions. This would make our program a lot more interactive and would hopefully make it easier for students to learn.
